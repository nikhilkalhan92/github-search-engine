# find users on GitHub

In this demo, I have created an application that uses the GitHub API to show information to the person using it. 

The goal of the application is to

1. Provide a search form we can use to ask GitHub for some data about a specific user
2. We enter a specific GitHub username, hit enter and we will ask the GitHub API for information about this user
3. We'll show the user information on the screen
